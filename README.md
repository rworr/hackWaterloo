hackWaterloo
============

Attempt at twitter mood analysis at hackWaterloo hackathon, March 2014

Featuring use of GoogleAppEngine, Tweepy, and a sortable js lib from http://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable
This project didn't really work, partially because I attempted it over a 24h hackathon, 
so I couldn't get a large enough data set (twitter rate-limited me :( ), 
and also because this was my first attempt at machine learning so I had very little idea what I was doing :)

I might try and revisit the concept once I've actually researched it a bit more.
